# Rock Classification ML Prediction Module

A Python-based machine learning program designed to classify rocks based on geochemical data. This toolkit assists geoscientists in evaluating compositional datasets but can also be adapted for other non-geologic classification tasks.

## Features

- Implements five powerful machine learning classifiers:
  - Logistic Regression
  - Random Forest Classifier
  - Support Vector Machine (SVM) Classifier
  - Naive Bayes Classifier
  - Neural Network Classifier
- Allows users to select one or all classifiers for prediction
- Modular design supports easy adaptation and extension
- In-code comments and descriptions support clear interpretation

## Installation

Clone this repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/MasterGeochemAngel/Machine_Learning_Prediction_Module.git
```

Before running the program, install the required Python packages:

```bash
pip install pandas scikit-learn
```

Or install all dependencies using the requirements.txt file:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

1. Prepare your geochemical dataset as a `.csv` file.

2. Review the code and in-code documentation for configuration options.

3. Run the program.

4. Answer all prompts as specified.

This will return predicted classifications based on the selected model(s).
